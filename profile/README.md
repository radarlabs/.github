## 👋 Hey from Radar
[Radar](https://radar.com) is a location platform for developers — think of it like a Location OS to build experiences with geofencing, trip tracking, and geocoding. Thousands of developers already use Radar's SDKs and APIs to create product experiences like pickup and delivery tracking, location-triggered notifications, location verification, store locators, address autocomplete, and more.
